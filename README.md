# Chargebee Freshplug

Save your time. Focus on the customer.

# Description

If you're up for boosting your support team's productivity by leaps and bounds, then this plugin is for you.

With the Chargebee Freshplug installed, your support agents will be able to view the complete subscription details (right down to the activity timeline) of a customer right next to the corresponding support ticket.

No more juggling between apps. Focus on your customer without any distractions whatsoever.

Note: If a particular email address is associated with multiple Customers/Subscriptions in Chargebee, the widget will display the details of only one of those Customers/Subscriptions at random.

# Instructions

- Step 1: Sign up with Chargebee (If you already have an account, skip this step)
- Step 2: Click "Install"
- Step 3: Choose the position of the Subscription Details widget on the ticket details page
- Step 4: You'll be able to see the Chargebee widget on the ticket details page in Freshdesk with the following information:

  - Request to log in to your Chargebee account (if you are not already logged in to Chargebee)
  - Subscription details of the corresponding requestor (if you are already logged in to Chargebee)
